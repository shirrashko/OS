Q2:

ANSWERS:

# Assignment 1
Explanation of the results

Finally, the README file should contain an explanation of the results you obtained. What can we see in the
graph? Did you get the results you expected? Why? In your answer explain the difference between latency for random
and sequential array access patterns. Also address the difference between the latency for the different cache levels.

# Assignment 2
Explanation of the results


Q1: Measurement Variability
**Question:** How consistent are the measurements across multiple runs?
**Answer:** The measurements tend to be consistent when the system is idle. Small discrepancies observed can be
attributed to minor background processes. Measurements become inconsistent with significant CPU load from other
applications.

### Q2: Effect of Repetition on Measurements
**Question:** Does increasing the number of repetitions affect the average time of accessing the array?

**Answer:** Beyond a certain threshold, increasing the number of repetitions does not significantly affect the average
time, indicating that the measurement has reached a level of stability. The results plateau, suggesting that initial
cache effects are averaged out.

## Graphs and Screenshots
- `results_graph.png` - Graph depicting the memory access times as array size increases.
- `lscpu_output.png` - Screenshot showing the output of the `lscpu` command for system specification.
- `page_size_output.png` - Screenshot showing the output of the `getconf PAGE_SIZE` command, provided for the bonus part.

How to Build and Run
1. Ensure all source files and the Makefile are in the same directory.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the directory and run the command `make`.
3. Execute the program using `./memory_latency max_size factor repeat`.
   - Example: `./memory_latency 800 1.5 200`
4. To clean up object files and executable, run `make clean`.
